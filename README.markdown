# Living Bibliography

This app queries [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com) database (via API) for a specific taxon name and displays a list of references. The idea is to aggregate references about a specific species and extract some fun from it. For example, the most popular organisms, trending taxa, top authors by taxon, etc. Taxon search is powered by [uBio](http://www.ubio.com/) web services allowing the use of a scientific or common name in queries.
